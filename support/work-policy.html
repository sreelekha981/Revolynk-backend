              <h3>Who We Are - The Voyagers</h3>
              <p>
                At Revolynk, we call our team members "Voyagers". The word
                Voyager signifies a traveler who moves with purpose, speed, and
                determination toward new horizons. We believe our employees
                embody the same spirit - unmatchable energy, relentless
                curiosity, and a drive to discover what lies beyond the
                ordinary. Being a Voyager means more than just being part of a
                company; it means embarking on a journey of exploration,
                innovation, and growth. Every project is a voyage into uncharted
                territory, and every client partnership is an opportunity to
                chart new maps of success. Our Voyagers are leaders, dreamers,
                problem-solvers, and creators who never settle for less and
                always strive for the extraordinary. The spirit of Voyagers also
                represents collaboration and unity. Just as explorers rely on
                their crew to navigate vast oceans and unknown lands, we rely on
                each other to achieve greatness. Together, our Voyagers form a
                team that is fast, resilient, and visionary, building not only
                technologies but also futures.
              </p>

              <h3>Inspiration & Growth</h3>
              <p>
                Revolynk Techs Pvt Limited began with the belief that technology
                can shape a better tomorrow. From our early days, we focused on
                creating meaningful change in businesses, communities, and
                industries through advanced digital transformation. As we grow,
                we remain committed to nurturing talent, encouraging creativity,
                and building an environment where every Voyager can contribute,
                learn, and thrive. This handbook is not just a rulebook but also
                a guide to becoming a part of Revolynk's voyage. Every Voyager
                is encouraged to embrace our values, contribute to our mission,
                and work with dedication to make our shared vision a reality.

              <h2>2. Employment Terms</h2>

              <h3>2.1 Working Hours</h3>
              <p>
                At Revolynk Techs Pvt Limited, we operate with two main shifts
                to accommodate various business needs:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  General Shift (India) 9:30 AM to 6:30 PM IST, Monday through
                  Saturday.
                </li>
                <li>
                  International Night Shift (India) 7:00 PM to 3:00 AM IST,
                  Monday through Saturday, primarily for clients or projects
                  operating in different time zones.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                All shifts are onsite, and employees are expected to adhere to
                their designated shift timings. Punctuality and attendance are
                critical as they directly impact team coordination, project
                delivery, and client satisfaction. Employees must notify their
                manager in advance if they are unable to attend or will be late
                due to unforeseen circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>Additional Notes:</p>
              <p>
                Employees are encouraged to use their break time responsibly and
                maintain productivity during working hours. Shift schedules may
                occasionally be revised based on business requirements, and
                employees will be notified in advance.
              </p>

              <h3>2.2 Overtime Policy</h3>
              <p>
                Revolynk operates on a strict schedule-based system, and
                overtime is generally not applicable. Employees are expected to
                manage their work efficiently within their assigned shift hours.
                In situations where urgent work is assigned and deadlines are
                critical, employees must complete the tasks within the given
                timeframe. Failure to meet deadlines may affect performance
                evaluations, salary considerations, and future project
                allocations. While we do not offer overtime pay, exceptional
                contributions may be recognized in performance reviews or
                incentive programs. Employees are encouraged to communicate with
                their managers if workload issues arise to ensure balance and
                timely completion.
              </p>

              <h3>2.3 Probation Period</h3>
              <p>
                All new employees at Revolynk undergo a probation period
                designed to allow both the employee and the organization to
                evaluate suitability:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Regular employees: 2 months probation.</li>
                <li>Trainees / Interns: 3 months probation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                During probation, employees are expected to demonstrate skills,
                dedication, adaptability, and alignment with Revolynk's values.
                Regular feedback will be provided, and managers may schedule
                review meetings to discuss performance and expectations.
              </p>
              <h4>Confirmation:</h4>
              <p>
                Upon successful completion of the probation period, employees
                will receive a formal confirmation of employment. Unsatisfactory
                performance, misconduct, or failure to meet expectations may
                lead to an extension of probation or termination as deemed
                appropriate by management.
              </p>

              <h3>2.4 Notice Period</h3>
              <p>
                Revolynk's notice period policy ensures smooth transitions while
                respecting the company and employee interests:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For resignation (regular employees): 60 days written notice is
                  required. This allows proper handover of responsibilities and
                  minimizes disruption to ongoing projects. Employees must
                  complete all pending work and assist in knowledge transfer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For termination by management: There is no probation or notice
                  requirement, and termination can be immediate in cases of
                  misconduct, breach of company policies, or business necessity.

              <h2>3. Code of Conduct</h2>

              <h3>3.1 Dress Code</h3>
              <p>
                At Revolynk Techs Pvt Limited, employees are encouraged to
                maintain a flexible and professional dress code that reflects
                both comfort and respect for the workplace. On general working
                days, employees may choose attire that is smart-casual and
                appropriate for client interactions and team meetings. Certain
                occasions, such as cultural events, client visits, or designated
                theme days (e.g., traditional day, formal day), require
                employees to dress according to specific instructions
                communicated in advance. Compliance with these dress guidelines
                ensures a consistent professional image for the company and
                fosters a cohesive workplace culture. The dress code is not just
                about appearance but also about showing respect to colleagues,
                clients, and the professional environment. Employees are
                expected to exercise good judgment and maintain attire that is
                neat, clean, and safe.
              </p>

              <h3>3.2 Expected Professional Behavior</h3>
              <p>
                Revolynk values respect, integrity, and professionalism in all
                interactions. Every employee, regardless of position, is
                expected to demonstrate proper conduct in all forms including
                verbal and non-verbal communication, posture, and workplace
                etiquette.
              </p>
              <p>Professional behavior includes, but is not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Speaking respectfully to colleagues, managers, and clients.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Listening actively and responding appropriately in meetings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintaining courteous interactions during email, chat, and
                  virtual communication.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Avoiding any form of harassment, discrimination, or offensive
                  behavior.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Employees must also respect personal and professional
                boundaries. This fosters a harmonious and collaborative
                workplace, where trust, cooperation, and productivity are
                prioritized. Misconduct or repeated unprofessional behavior may
                lead to disciplinary action, including warnings or termination,
                depending on severity.
              </p>

              <h3>3.3 Confidentiality & Data Protection</h3>
              <p>
                As a technology-driven company working with Al, cloud
                infrastructure, cybersecurity, and application development,
                confidentiality is paramount. All employees must protect
                sensitive information, whether it belongs to Revolynk or its
                clients. This includes project data, client credentials,
                business strategies, internal processes, and intellectual
                property.
              </p>
              <p>Key confidentiality rules:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Do not disclose client or company data to unauthorized
                  persons, whether inside or outside the organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Access to client systems, databases, and project files is
                  granted only for work purposes; any misuse is strictly
                  prohibited.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Employees must use strong passwords, secure devices, and
                  follow cybersecurity best practices to prevent unauthorized
                  access or data breaches.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Violation of confidentiality or data protection rules can result
                in disciplinary action, legal consequences, or termination, as
                per company policy and applicable Indian laws, including
                contracts, IP laws, and cyber regulations. Employees are also
                required to sign NDA agreements where applicable before
                accessing sensitive client or company information.
              </p>

              <h3>3.4 Use of Company Assets</h3>
              <p>
                Employees are entrusted with company assets such as laptops,
                software licenses, emails, communication devices, and other
                tools necessary to perform their roles effectively. These assets
                must be used responsibly, ethically, and solely for work-related
                purposes.
              </p>
              <p>Guidelines for use of company assets include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Do not install unauthorized software or engage in illegal
                  activities on company devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Email and internal communication tools must be used
                  professionally; personal use should be limited and must not
                  compromise security or productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any damage, loss, or misuse of company property must be
                  reported immediately to the manager or IT department.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Misuse of company assets - including negligence, theft, or
                unauthorized distribution of proprietary software or data - will
                be treated as a serious violation and may lead to immediate
                disciplinary action, recovery of losses, and legal proceedings
                if necessary. Employees are expected to treat company resources
                with the same care and diligence as their own property.

              <h2>4. Leave & Holidays</h2>

              <h3>4.1 Annual Leave Entitlement (Paid Leave)</h3>
              <p>
                At Revolynk Techs Pvt Limited, each employee is entitled to 12
                paid annual leave days per calendar year. These leaves are
                provided to allow Voyagers to rest, recharge, and manage
                personal commitments while maintaining high productivity and
                project continuity.
              </p>
              <p>Key rules for annual leave:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Strict Scheduling: Annual leave cannot be taken in consecutive
                  blocks that exceed standard leave policy. This ensures
                  continuous team availability for project deadlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No Weekend Overlap: Employees cannot combine annual leave with
                  weekends to create extended leave periods unless specifically
                  approved by management.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Festival Restrictions: Leaves immediately before or after
                  major festival days are generally not allowed, to maintain
                  operational continuity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Approval Process: All leave requests must be submitted in
                  advance through the HR portal or Voyager portal and require
                  manager approval. Unauthorized leave or failure to follow the
                  process may result in leave denial or disciplinary action.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Annual leaves are calculated on a pro-rata basis for new
                employees, and any unutilized leaves at the end of the year may
                be carried forward only with management approval. The leave
                policy ensures fairness, operational stability, and
                accountability for all team members.
              </p>

              <h3>4.2 Sick Leave Policy</h3>
              <p>
                Revolynk provides 8 paid sick leaves per calendar year to
                accommodate unforeseen medical or health-related situations.
                These leaves are separate from annual leave and are intended to
                support the well-being of our Voyagers.
              </p>
              <p>Guidelines for sick leave:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Employees must submit a leave request through the HR system or
                  Voyager portal prior to taking sick leave, wherever possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sick leave requests must clearly mention the reason and
                  duration of absence. In case of prolonged illness, medical
                  certification may be requested.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unreported absences or misuse of sick leave may result in
                  deduction of pay or disciplinary action.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This policy emphasizes responsible and transparent use of sick
                leave while ensuring that teams remain coordinated and clients
                receive uninterrupted service.
              </p>

              <h3>4.3 Public Holidays</h3>
              <p>
                Revolynk observes all national holidays of India. Holidays
                specific to individual states are not automatically granted
                unless explicitly communicated by management.
              </p>
              <p>Guidelines for holidays:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Voyagers are entitled to take these holidays as per the
                  official national calendar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a national holiday falls during an assigned shift,
                  employees are not expected to work, unless critical business
                  requirements demand otherwise. In such cases, prior approval
                  from management will be communicated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Holidays are not transferable and cannot be exchanged for
                  additional leave unless exceptional circumstances are approved
                  by HR.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This ensures consistency across all teams and maintains equity
                among employees working in different locations or shifts.
              </p>

              <h3>4.4 Work From Home / Remote Work Policy</h3>
              <p>
                Revolynk provides limited flexibility for remote work to support
                work-life balance while ensuring productivity and
                accountability.
              </p>
              <p>Policy Guidelines:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Monthly Option: Employees may opt for up to 2 work-from-home
                  days per month, which must be taken together as a single
                  block, not separately.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Shift Adherence: During remote work, employees must adhere
                  strictly to their assigned shifts (General Shift or
                  International Night Shift) and remain logged in and available
                  throughout the shift.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Collaboration: Employees must actively collaborate with their
                  team, participate in meetings, and ensure that project
                  deliverables are met.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-Compliance: Failure to adhere to the above rules -
                  including absence from virtual meetings, missed tasks, or
                  inactivity will result in deduction of salary for that day
                  without exception.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This policy balances flexibility with accountability, ensuring
                that remote work does not compromise team collaboration, client
                commitments, or project timelines.

              <h3>7.1 Grounds for Warnings or Termination</h3>
              <p>
                At Revolynk Techs Pvt Limited, maintaining a professional,
                ethical, and collaborative workplace is critical. Employees are
                expected to adhere to company policies, legal requirements, and
                professional standards. Failure to do so may result in
                disciplinary action, which can range from verbal warnings to
                termination depending on the severity of the violation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Common grounds for disciplinary action include, but are not
                limited to:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Misconduct: Inappropriate behavior towards colleagues,
                  clients, or management, including harassment, bullying, or
                  offensive communication.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Absenteeism & Punctuality Issues: Repeated unauthorized
                  absences, frequent late arrivals, or leaving work without
                  approval.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Breach of Confidentiality or Data Security: Unauthorized
                  sharing of company or client data, violation of IT security
                  policies, or mishandling sensitive information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Negligence or Poor Performance: Failure to meet deadlines,
                  repeated errors, or consistent underperformance despite
                  feedback and support.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Violation of Company Policies: Non-compliance with workplace
                  rules, IT usage guidelines, or health and safety regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Conflict of Interest: Engaging in activities that compete with
                  or harm the company's business interests.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Each violation is investigated fairly, and disciplinary actions
                are taken proportionally to the seriousness and recurrence of
                the behavior.
              </p>

              <h3>7.2 Escalation Process</h3>
              <p>
                Revolynk follows a structured escalation process to address
                violations, providing employees with clarity, fairness, and
                opportunities to improve:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Verbal Warning: Minor infractions or first-time incidents are
                  addressed through a verbal discussion with the reporting
                  manager. The goal is to provide feedback and guidance for
                  improvement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Written Warning: If the behavior persists or the violation is
                  more serious, a formal written warning is issued, detailing
                  the nature of the violation, expected corrective actions, and
                  consequences of further non-compliance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  HR Review and Final Action: Continued or severe violations are
                  escalated to the HR department and senior management. HR
                  evaluates the situation, reviews prior warnings, and
                  determines appropriate action, which may include probation
                  extension, salary deductions, suspension, or termination.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This process ensures transparency, fairness, and documentation
                of all actions taken while allowing employees an opportunity to
                correct behavior.
              </p>

              <h3>7.3 Immediate Termination Rules</h3>
              <p>
                Certain violations are considered gross misconduct and may lead
                to immediate termination, bypassing the standard warning
                process. Such actions seriously jeopardize the company, clients,
                or colleagues and require prompt resolution.
              </p>
              <p>Examples of gross misconduct include:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Fraud or Theft: Misappropriation of company funds, assets, or

                  disciplinary action, legal liability, or termination, as well
                  as civil or criminal consequences under Indian IT and data
                  protection laws.
                </li>
