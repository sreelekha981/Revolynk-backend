            <h3>Preamble - What this document is for</h3>
            <p>
              This Terms of Use document (the "Terms") explains, in clear and
              practical language, how Revolynk Techs Pvt Limited ("Revolynk",
              "we", "our" or "us") offers professional services to business
              clients and organisations. It describes what we provide, how
              projects start and proceed, what we expect from our clients, how
              payments and refunds are handled, and the legal protections and
              responsibilities that apply to both parties. We have written these
              Terms to be both thorough and readable so clients can understand
              the way we operate before they engage us. These Terms apply to
              your use of our website, any communications with our team about
              proposed services, and to any formal Statement of Work (SOW),
              proposal or service agreement entered into between you and
              Revolynk. Where an SOW or a separate contract exists, that
              document will govern the specific project details; however, these
              Terms form the baseline set of rules that apply to all engagements
              unless explicitly overridden in writing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Important:</strong> This document is intended to be clear
              and practical guidance for clients. It does not replace legal
              advice. We recommend that clients take independent legal counsel
              for specific legal questions about their project or use of our
              services.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>1. Definitions and interpretation</h2>
            <p>
              For clarity, the following key terms are used throughout these
              Terms.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Client / You</strong> - the individual, company or other
                organisation that purchases or enquires about Revolynk's
                services. When you accept an SOW, you represent that you have
                authority to bind the organisation you represent.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Services</strong> - the professional activities listed
                in Section 2 below and any additional or related activities set
                out in an SOW, proposal, or contract (for example: development,
                design, consulting, security testing, cloud management,
                marketing campaigns, and related professional work).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Deliverables</strong> - the tangible results of the
                Services (for example: source code, executables, design files,
                reports, configurations, campaign assets, or documentation) that
                Revolynk produces and hands over to the Client under the agreed
                SOW.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Statement of Work (SOW)</strong> - a written document
                (or part of a contract) that describes the specific scope,
                deliverables, timelines, milestones, acceptance criteria, fees,
                and other project-specific terms. Each SOW is attached to and
                governed by these Terms unless expressly stated otherwise.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <hr />

            <h2>2. Our services - what we do and how to think about them</h2>
            <p>
              Below is a short, plain-language description of each major service
              line we offer, followed by an explanation of typical scope,
              expected outcomes, and common limitations. Each service is
              custom-priced and documented in an SOW before work begins.
            </p>

            <h3>2.1 AI & Data Analytics</h3>
            <p>
              We design and build data-driven solutions that help businesses
              make better decisions. This includes data strategy, data
              engineering (ETL), analytics dashboards, predictive models, and
              custom machine learning solutions. Our work often begins with a
              discovery phase to understand your data sources, data quality,
              business goals, and technical constraints. In practice, AI and
              analytics work is iterative: we prototype models, validate them
              against real data, and refine performance based on business KPIs.
              Outputs can include dashboards, model code, deployment scripts,
              and documentation. Because models depend on input data quality and
              the ongoing availability of data, we clearly document assumptions,
              limitations and expected maintenance requirements for models we
              deliver.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Cloud Services</h3>
            <p>
              We provide cloud architecture, migration, deployment, optimisation
              and ongoing platform management on major cloud providers. This
              includes setting up infrastructure-as-code, automated backups,
              security hardening, cost optimisation and scaling strategies
              tailored to your needs. Cloud-related engagements usually start
              with an assessment of your current environment and business needs,
              followed by an architecture proposal and a migration plan if
              required. We emphasise automatable and repeatable setups (for
              example, using Terraform, Ansible, or managed services) to reduce
              manual errors and improve reliability. Ongoing cloud management
              will include monitoring, patching, and incident response as
              specified in the SOW.
            </p>

            <h3>2.3 Cyber Security</h3>
            <p>
              Our cyber security service line includes security assessments,
              penetration testing, security architecture review, implementation
              of security controls and monitoring. We help identify
              vulnerabilities, prioritise fixes, and implement controls that
              reduce risk and help meet regulatory or industry standards.
              Security engagements are sensitive and often require privileged
              access to systems. We follow strict protocols for conducting tests
              safely and for reporting findings. Our recommendations are
              practical and risk-based; we do not guarantee absolute security
              but aim to materially reduce risk exposure and improve security
              posture through remediation and monitoring.
            </p>

            <h3>2.4 Web & Mobile Applications</h3>
            <p>
              We design and build consumer and enterprise web and mobile
              applications, including user experience design, front-end and
              back-end development, APIs, and integrations with third-party
              systems. Projects may include single-page applications,
              progressive web apps, native or cross-platform mobile apps, and
              backend services. Deliverables typically consist of source code,
              build pipelines, deployment configurations, environments for
              testing and staging, and handover documentation. We emphasise
              maintainable code, automated testing, and continuous integration /
              continuous deployment (CI/CD) to reduce deployment risk. The
              client is responsible for third-party platform accounts (e.g.,
              Apple App Store, Google Play, hosting accounts) unless otherwise
              stated.
            </p>

            <h3>2.5 Marketing & Experience</h3>
            <p>
              We plan and execute digital marketing and experience improvements,
              such as SEO, content strategy, paid media campaigns, social media
              management, and conversion optimisation. These services are often
              measured against business metrics such as traffic, lead volume,
              conversion rate, or ROI. Marketing outcomes depend on many
              variables beyond Revolynk's direct control (for example: platform
              algorithms, client approvals, media budgets, and competitor
              activity). We will set measurable goals, run agreed campaigns, and
              provide transparent reporting. Ongoing optimisation and
              adjustments are part of our managed marketing services as
              specified in the SOW.
            </p>

            <h3>2.6 Tech Consulting</h3>
            <p>
              Our consulting services cover IT strategy, digital transformation
              roadmaps, technology selection, vendor evaluation, and process
              optimisation. We work closely with leadership and technical teams
              to align technology choices with business goals. Consulting
              projects are advisory and outcome-oriented: we provide
              recommendations, implementation roadmaps and, where appropriate,
              assist with vendor implementation. Clients should treat consulting
              deliverables as professional advice rather than guaranteed
              outcomes—success depends on execution, budget, and stakeholder
              alignment.
            </p>

            <h3>2.7 VFX & Game Design</h3>
            <p>
              We deliver design, animation, VFX, and game development services
              for interactive and media projects. This includes concept art,
              asset creation, animation, game mechanics, and pipeline
              integration to ship polished creative products. Creative work
              often requires iterative review cycles and client feedback. We
              provide milestone-based deliverables and include source assets and
              documentation as agreed in the SOW. Timelines can vary
              significantly depending on asset complexity and review turnaround
              times.
            </p>

            <h2>
              3. Who should use our services (Client eligibility & expectations)
            </h2>
            <p>
              Our services are intended for businesses, organisations and
              authorised representatives seeking professional technology
              solutions. By engaging us, you confirm you have the authority to
              act for the business or entity that is contracting our services,
              and that you will provide truthful and complete information
              necessary for us to perform our work. We expect clients to be
              responsive during active projects - answering questions, providing
              access to resources, and approving deliverables in a timely
              manner. Delays caused by late feedback, unavailable stakeholders,
              or missing access can push timelines; we document these impacts
              and will propose revised schedules and potential cost adjustments
              when required. We do not provide services to individuals or
              entities that are subject to sanctions, formally banned, or
              engaged in illicit activities. If at any point we reasonably
              suspect that the work may facilitate illegal conduct, we reserve
              the right to pause or terminate the engagement and notify
              appropriate authorities if required by law.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>4. Engagement process - proposals, SOWs and acceptance</h2>
            <p>
              All paid engagements begin with a written proposal or a Statement
              of Work (SOW). The SOW describes scope, deliverables, acceptance
              criteria, milestones, timelines, fees, payment schedule, and any
              special terms. The SOW may be attached to or incorporated into a
              master services agreement between the parties. Clients must sign
              or otherwise formally accept the SOW before work begins. Signing
              the SOW confirms agreement with the responsibilities outlined
              (including client obligations such as access, approvals and
              third-party costs) and with the fees and payment schedule. Where
              urgent or ad hoc work is required, parties may agree to a
              simplified engagement in writing (email or written purchase order)
              for limited fixed-scope tasks. If the Client asks for work outside
              the scope of the SOW after acceptance, the parties will follow the
              Change Request procedure in Section 7 below. Work will only
              proceed against a written change request accepted by both parties,
              which may include revised timelines and additional fees.

            <h2>5. Project lifecycle - planning through delivery</h2>
            <p>
              Every project follows common phases: discovery, design, build,
              test, deploy, and handover. During discovery, we gather
              requirements, assess technical constraints, and agree success
              criteria. This phase may include workshops and diagnostic testing
              to determine the true scope. The design phase transforms
              requirements into specifications, wireframes, UI designs or
              architecture documents. During build, our engineers and creatives
              create the agreed deliverables. Testing includes unit tests,
              integration tests, user acceptance testing (UAT) and security
              checks as appropriate. Finally, deployment places deliverables in
              production and handover transfers source code, assets,
              documentation, and accounts to the client. At each phase we
              provide status updates and ask for client approvals at predefined
              milestones. The SOW sets acceptance criteria and the number of
              review/iteration cycles included. Additional rounds of review or
              rework beyond the included cycles may incur additional fees.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>6. Deliverables, documentation and acceptance criteria</h2>
            <p>
              Deliverables are the tangible outputs we create for you—for
              example, a codebase, compiled application, campaign assets, or a
              security report. Each SOW will specify the deliverables in
              sufficient detail, together with formats, versions, and handover
              items. We provide documentation that explains how to deploy,
              maintain and use the deliverables. Documentation may include
              deployment guides, run books, API documentation, and a list of
              dependencies. Proper documentation reduces future support costs
              and makes ongoing maintenance smoother for you or your internal
              teams. Acceptance criteria and review periods will be stated in
              the SOW. Typically, the client will have a defined window (e.g.,
              7-14 calendar days) to review deliverables and return approval or
              a list of defects. If defects are identified, Revolynk will
              correct them per the agreed defect resolution process outlined in
              the SOW.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>7. Change requests and scope management</h2>
            <p>
              Projects often change after they start—new priorities appear,
              additional features are requested, or regulations require
              adjustments. To keep projects predictable, all changes to scope
              must be raised as a Change Request in writing. A Change Request
              will describe the requested change, the impact on schedule,
              resources, and cost, and require written acceptance by both
              parties before work begins. Where emergency work is required (for
              example, urgent security remediation), Revolynk may act
              immediately but will document the emergency change and seek
              approval and payment terms retroactively. We manage scope
              carefully because frequent unplanned changes (scope creep) can
              increase costs and extend delivery dates. The SOW will state the
              number of included revisions; beyond that, change requests will be
              time and materials or may be quoted as a fixed fee, depending on
              the nature of the work.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>8. Pricing, estimates, and taxes</h2>
            <p>
              Our proposals and SOWs will include a clear fee structure. Fees
              may be fixed-price for well-defined projects, time-and-materials
              for discovery or advisory work, or subscription/retainer-based for
              ongoing services. Estimates are based on the information available
              at proposal time. Estimates are valid for the period stated in the
              proposal. Should requirements materially change, we will issue a
              revised estimate or Change Request. Clients are responsible for
              any taxes, duties, or similar charges that apply to the services,
              unless otherwise stated; all fees are quoted exclusive of taxes
              unless explicitly specified. For international clients, currency
              and remittance details will be provided in the invoice. Any bank
              fees, currency conversion costs, or payment platform fees are
              typically paid by the client unless otherwise agreed.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>9. Invoicing, payment terms and late payments</h2>
            <p>
              Invoices are issued according to the SOW payment schedule. Unless
              otherwise agreed, all invoices are due within 3 (three) working
              days from the invoice date. For subscription or retainer services,
              invoices are typically issued monthly in advance. We accept
              payments by bank transfer, UPI, or other payment methods specified
              on the invoice. Clients should ensure payments include any
              required reference or invoice number to avoid misapplication. If a
              client disputes an invoice, they must notify Revolynk in writing
              within 7 calendar days of receipt; undisputed portions of the
              invoice remain payable according to the original terms. If a
              payment becomes overdue, Revolynk may suspend the provision of
              services after giving reasonable written notice. Continued
              non-payment may result in termination of services. Late payments
              may attract interest or recovery costs as set out in the SOW or as
              permitted by applicable law.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Refund and cancellation policy (detailed)</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Cancellation before work begins:</strong> If a client
                cancels an engagement before any work has been started, Revolynk
                will refund any advance payment within 3 working days after
                receiving the written cancellation, less any non-recoverable
                third-party costs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cancellation after work has started:</strong> If the
                client terminates a project after Revolynk has commenced work,
                refunds (if any) will be calculated based on work completed to
                date, documented costs incurred by Revolynk, and any
                non-recoverable third-party expenses. We will provide a clear
                accounting of the work performed and costs incurred to justify
                the retained amount, and any refundable balance will be paid
                within a reasonable timeframe.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Subscription and recurring services:</strong> For
                ongoing services billed monthly or by subscription, fees for
                completed service periods are generally non-refundable. If a
                client terminates mid-period, Revolynk will normally pro-rate
                subsequent invoices where appropriate; however, special terms
                may apply depending on the SOW.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Exceptional refunds:</strong> In limited, exceptional
                circumstances (for example, clear error by Revolynk or failure
                to deliver key obligations), Revolynk may offer a goodwill
                refund or credit, at its discretion. Any such agreement will be
                documented in writing.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <hr />

            <h2>11. Access, credentials and client responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
              Clients must provide Revolynk with the timely, secure access
              credentials required to carry out the work (including test
              accounts, servers, APIs, or third-party platforms). We will use
              these credentials only for authorised work under the SOW and will
              follow security practices when storing or accessing credentials.
              Clients are responsible for maintaining and securing any accounts
              in their name (e.g., domain registrars, cloud providers, app store
              developer accounts). If Revolynk needs to manage or operate such
              accounts on behalf of the client, we will do so under documented
              access arrangements and with the client's consent. Revolynk may
              request delegated access that can be revoked by the client at any
              time. Where a client's failure to provide access, approvals, or
              necessary information delays a project, Revolynk will document the
              delay and propose revised timelines and fees as needed. Timely
              cooperation by the client is critical to meet agreed deadlines.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>12. Security, data handling and backups</h2>
            <p>
              Revolynk implements industry-standard security measures
              appropriate to the services we provide, including secure
              transmission of data, controlled access to systems, and secure
              storage of credentials and sensitive materials. We adopt
              reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect client
              data from unauthorised access or disclosure. For projects where
              Revolynk hosts or processes client data (for example, cloud
              managed services or analytics platforms), our SOW will specify the
              data handling procedures, retention periods, and backup
              strategies. While we will take reasonable steps to maintain
              backups and redundancy, clients should maintain their own backups
              and records; Revolynk is not responsible for client data loss
              where it results from client actions, third-party failures, or
              force majeure events. In case of a security incident affecting
              client systems or data where Revolynk's services are implicated,
              we will notify the client promptly, investigate the incident, and
              recommend remediation steps. Where contractual or regulatory
              obligations require special incident reporting timelines (for
              example, personal data breaches under privacy laws), those will be
              documented in the SOW.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>13. Confidentiality and NDAS</h2>
            <p>
              Both parties agree to keep confidential any non-public, commercial
              or technical information exchanged during the engagement. This
              includes trade secrets, strategic plans, customer lists, or
              sensitive technical configurations (collectively, "Confidential
              Information"). Confidentiality obligations survive termination of
              the project and continue for a period specified in the SOW or for
              a default period of two years after termination where not
              otherwise agreed. Exclusions typically include information that is
              public, already known to the recipient, independently developed by
              the recipient, or required to be disclosed by law. Where required,
              both parties will enter into a separate Non-Disclosure Agreement
              (NDA) before sharing particularly sensitive information. An NDA
              will specify permitted disclosures, handling requirements, and any
              special return or destruction obligations at the end of the
              engagement.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Ownership of deliverables:</strong> Upon full payment of
                all fees due under the SOW, Revolynk assigns to the client
                ownership of the final deliverables as described in the SOW (for
                example, bespoke source code, final designs and campaign
                assets). This assignment applies only to the deliverables
                specifically created for the client and paid in full.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Revolynk's retained rights:</strong> Revolynk retains
                ownership of any pre-existing materials, tools, frameworks,
                templates or libraries that we used in creating your
                deliverables. Where Revolynk provides such pre-existing or
                reusable components, we grant the client a non-exclusive,
                perpetual, royalty-free licence to use those elements as
                necessary to use the deliverables, unless otherwise negotiated.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Open-source and third-party components:</strong> Many
                software projects include open-source or third-party libraries
                licensed under their own terms. The client agrees to abide by
                any licence obligations of such third-party components. Revolynk
                will disclose known third-party components in the SOW or
                documentation where relevant.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Moral rights and credit:</strong> Revolynk may reserve
                the right to be acknowledged as the author of work in portfolio
                materials, case studies or press releases, subject to client
                privacy choices and any confidentiality constraints. If
                acknowledgement would conflict with the client's confidentiality
                or brand policy, we will not include identifying details without
                consent.

            <h2>15. Acceptable use and prohibited activities</h2>
            <p>
              Clients must not use Revolynk services to carry out unlawful,
              harmful, infringing or malicious activities. Prohibited activities
              include (but are not limited to) fraud, distribution of malware,
              infringement of third-party rights, hosting illegal content, or
              attempts to interfere with or exploit other clients' systems.
              Revolynk reserves the right to refuse work that enables unlawful
              conduct or to suspend access to services where we reasonably
              suspect misuse. Where misuse is discovered after work has been
              delivered, Revolynk may suspend maintenance or hosting services
              and will cooperate with lawful requests from authorities. Clients
              are responsible for the legality of the content and materials they
              ask us to host, publish or distribute. Revolynk is not responsible
              for client content that infringes third-party rights or violates
              law, and client indemnity obligations apply in such circumstances
              as set out in Section 18.

                <strong>Our warranties:</strong> Revolynk warrants that it will
                perform services with reasonable care, skill and diligence in
                line with accepted industry standards. We will use qualified
                personnel and reasonable project management and quality
                assurance procedures.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No absolute guarantees:</strong> Technology and
                marketing results depend on many factors beyond our control.
                Accordingly, Revolynk does not warrant that our services will
                produce specific business results (for example, a guaranteed
                sales increase, specific ranking positions in search engines, or
                that software will be entirely free from defects in all
                circumstances). Where specific performance guarantees are
                agreed, they will be written into the SOW with clear metrics and

            <h2>17. Limitation of liability (detailed)</h2>
            <p>
              To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Revolynk's
              aggregate liability arising out of or related to these Terms or
              any SOW (whether in contract, tort including negligence, or
              otherwise) will not exceed the total fees paid by the client to
              Revolynk under the relevant SOW in the 12 months preceding the
              event giving rise to liability. Revolynk will not be liable for
              indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages,
              including but not limited to loss of profits, business
              interruption, or loss of data, even if advised of the possibility
              of such damages. This limitation applies regardless of the form of
              claim. Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
              limitation of liability for certain types of damages; where such
              limitations are unenforceable, Revolynk's liability will be
              limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>18. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              The client agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Revolynk and its
              officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from and
              against any third-party claims, damages, losses or expenses
              (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to:
              (a) the client's breach of these Terms or SOW; (b) client content
              that infringes third-party rights or violates applicable law; (c)
              improper use of the deliverables or services; or (d) client
              negligence or wilful misconduct. Revolynk will promptly notify the
              client of any claim for which indemnity is sought, and will
              provide reasonable cooperation in the defence of such claim. The
              client will control the defence and settlement of any indemnified
              claim, provided any settlement does not impose obligations on
              Revolynk without Revolynk's prior written consent.

            <hr />

            <h2>19. Third-party services, licences and integrations</h2>
            <p>
              Projects often require third-party products or services (for
              example cloud providers, analytics platforms, libraries, payment
              gateways, app stores, or marketing ad platforms). The client is
              responsible for compliance with the terms and fees of such
              third-party services. Revolynk may assist with procurement or
              configuration of third-party services, but unless explicitly
              agreed in writing we do not assume third-party vendor liability.
              Any third-party subscription fees are paid by the client directly
              to the provider or reimbursed to Revolynk if Revolynk pays them on
              the client's behalf. Where a third-party licence or service is
              critical to the performance of deliverables, Revolynk will point
              this out in the SOW and advise on licence terms or alternatives.
              Client acceptance of the SOW implies acceptance of any required
              third-party components described therein.

            <h2>20. Support, maintenance and service levels</h2>
            <p>
              Support and maintenance terms (including response times, update
              schedules, and covered activities) are specified in the SOW.
              Support may be offered as a time-and-materials service, as a
              retainer with a fixed monthly fee, or included for a limited
              warranty period after delivery as described in the SOW. Service
              Level Agreements (SLAs) for uptime, response and resolution times
              are available for eligible services (for example cloud management
              or monitoring). SLAs are quantified and documented in the SOW or a
              separate SLA document and may include remedies or credits where we
              fail to meet agreed targets. Emergency support (for example,
              critical production outages) is treated on a priority basis where
              a client has an active support agreement. If we provide emergency
              assistance outside of a support agreement, such assistance will be
              charged at our standard emergency rates unless otherwise agreed.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>21. Termination and suspension</h2>
            <p>
              Either party may terminate an SOW for material breach if the other
              party fails to remedy the breach within a specified cure period
              after written notice. Revolynk may suspend services immediately if
              a client's actions pose an immediate security risk, or if payments
              are overdue and a reasonable notice period has passed. On
              termination, the client must pay for work completed and any
              non-recoverable costs incurred up to the effective date of
              termination. Revolynk will deliver any completed deliverables
              against payment for the delivered work. For subscription services,
              termination procedures and any required notice periods will be as
              set out in the SOW. Termination does not relieve either party of
              obligations that survive termination, such as confidentiality,
              intellectual property ownership, indemnities and limitations of
              liability. Where applicable, the parties will cooperate to ensure
              an orderly transition of services.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>22. Force majeure</h2>
            <p>
              Revolynk is not liable for delays or failures to perform that are
              due to events beyond its reasonable control, including natural
              disasters, war, acts of terrorism, strikes, outages from
              third-party providers, pandemics, government actions, or other
              force majeure events. Where such events occur, the affected party
              will notify the other and use reasonable efforts to resume
              performance. If a force majeure event continues for a prolonged
              period (for example, more than 60 days), either party may be
              entitled to terminate the SOW without liability for breach. In
              such cases, we will follow the termination and settlement process
              described in Section 21.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>23. Dispute resolution and governing law</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms and any SOW are governed by the laws of India. Any
              dispute arising from or in connection with these Terms will first
              be addressed in good faith through negotiation between senior
              representatives of both parties. If negotiation fails, the parties
              agree to submit to mediation (if available and appropriate). If
              mediation does not resolve the dispute, the parties may pursue
              remedies in the courts of Hyderabad, Telangana, India, unless the
              parties agree in writing to an alternative dispute resolution
              process.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>24. Notices and communications</h2>
            <p>
              All formal notices under these Terms must be in writing and sent
              to the contact addresses specified in the SOW or to:
              reach@revolynk.com for Revolynk and the primary email address on
              file for the client. Routine project communication may occur by
              email, collaboration tools, or scheduled meetings. Notices are
              effective: (a) if emailed, on the day of transmission (provided
              sender retains proof of successful transmission); (b) if delivered
              by courier, on receipt; or (c) if posted on our website, as of the
              posting date. Parties should ensure that administrative contact
              details remain up to date throughout the engagement.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>25. Changes to these Terms</h2>
            <p>
              We may update these Terms from time to time. For minor
              clarifications, changes may be posted and will apply to future
              engagements. Material changes affecting active SOWs will not be
              applied retroactively to work already underway unless both parties
              agree in writing. We encourage clients to review Terms
              periodically; the "Last updated" date at the top indicates the
              latest revision. If a client does not agree with material changes,
              they should notify Revolynk and may have the right to terminate
              certain future services as described in the SOW.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>26. Severability, waiver and entire agreement</h2>
            <p>
              If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or
              unenforceable, that provision will be modified where possible to
              reflect the parties' intent, and the remaining provisions will
              remain in full force. Failure by either party to exercise a right
              under these Terms is not a waiver of that right. These Terms,
              together with any SOW, invoices and any executed NDAs, constitute
              the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject
              matter and supersede prior understandings and communications.
            </p>

            <h2>27. Feedback, testimonials and portfolio use</h2>
            <p>
              Clients may provide feedback, testimonials or case study
              materials. With client consent we may publish anonymised or
              attributed case studies and work samples in our portfolio and
              marketing materials. We will not publish confidential or sensitive
              details without prior written permission. If you prefer Revolynk
              not to include your project in public portfolios, please state
              this in the SOW and we will respect your preference, subject to
              any legal or regulatory obligations.

            <p>
              This Terms of Use document is written to be clear and
              comprehensive for business clients; however, it does not
